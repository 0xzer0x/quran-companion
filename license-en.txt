"Waqf" General Public License
بسم الله الرّحمن الرّحيم

In the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful

"Waqf" General Public License 2.0, 3 Muharram 1435

This is the informal English translation of Waqf General Public License. Anything but the Arabic version of the license has no value except for convenience of our English speaking users. When we talk about the License we refer to the Arabic version, which is the only one we officially offer, we will try our best to make other translation as accurate as possible but because of the nature of human languages we use one single reference language.
Preamble

This document is the controlling agreement for the use of the material covered by it, as it is considered to be the contract signed between the publisher and the beneficiary, as each contract has its own rules and conditions. We see that monopolistic agreements not only restrict the beneficiary but affect the value of intellectual work, From a light to a mere commodity, where the intellectual property right is owned by the first intellectual depositor. Our vision for this property is limited to the moral form of the intellectual work itself in accordance with the rules below, unlike the monopoly licenses that place unfair restrictions that keep the second party weak and encouraged to violate them as much as possible.

We have a different vision, we offer our work (like computer software) to please Allah, and this is the pillar of this license which distinguish it from proprietary licenses. Any other intention (like spreading knowledge or getting profits) should be accomplished in ways that does not go against our primary moral aim.

According to our beliefs (which we don't enforce on any one, and you may or may not share it with us) that Islam certainly forbids monopoly and concealing knowledge in general, and this comes from:

    The sound Hadith (saying of prophet Muhammad PBUH): “Who conceal any type of knowledge will be bridle with a bridle of fire on the Day of Resurrection.” 1)
    Islamic Jurisprudence has specified what can be owned, and the rules does not apply to ideas as it's not a bounded tangible object and almost all the terms of proprietary agreements fall in ruling of forbidden Gharar2) (a kind of fraud that use uncertainty to fool the customers) as we see in Imam Muslim Sahih description of that term {and below that term we classify so many actions like selling negligible objects or unknowns or what can't be delivered or things that are not fully owned by the seller} and such view is also shared by the four major scholars.
    The laws of Fiqh (Islamic Jurisprudence) have been perfected in the good centuries and no new rulings are allowed to be brought except for newly discovered things and this does not apply ideas as they did exist in the past centuries and Muslims massively spread them without owning them. FYI: Almost all the Islamic literature is freely available on the internet.
    Concealing useful knowledge from those who need it impose damage to people for temporal gains to few individuals. This can not be justified by Shari'a (Islamic Law) as there should be no harm nor malice.
    Even bringing interests to software publishers is not a valid excuse because there are some companies produce and publish software without owning them (proprietary software) and yet they gain profits.
    The so call “Intellectual Proprietary” is all about giving owners the right to forbid what Allah had made lawful to gain money, not by providing service nor goods. For the "owned" product is of uncertain and intangible nature and claiming its ownership opens the door for extortion.

We in Waqf (as in many anti-monopoly licenses) are concerned with the interest of the general public over its counterpart of those who glorify self-interest. We do not lose sight of our interest in the holder's interest in the reward of Allah Almighty. We believe that the copyright and distribution are "granted" and not "reserved" as stated in terms below. We stop here to clarify two points:

    First: The favor and ethical rights of the holder are preserved and acknowledged
    Second: original author and any other party have the right to get fees on enhancing the work or developing it or to provide paid services or paid courses …etc. but not the work in its intangible form. There is not contradiction between getting fees on services because what is covered by “Waqf” is the source form of the work not the media nor the service (the same way one can take fees on shipping fruits for a charitable Waqf fruit field or make juice)

Definitions
